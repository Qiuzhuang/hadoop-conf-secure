Quick Start

1. Set up your hadoop-runtime dir

  cd 
  git clone git://git.apache.org/hadoop-common.git
  cd hadoop-common
  mvn package -Pdist
  cd
  ls hadoop-common/hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-*

There should be a directory whose name begins with hadoop that's returned 
by this "ls". Find this suffix and use it below here:

  ln -s hadoop-common/hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-$SUFFIX hadoop-runtime

2. Create Kerberos Principals

  Within your top-level hadoop-conf dir:

  make principals

You may also do:

   make principals OPT1=VAL1 .. OPTn=VALn

where OPT=VAL pairs look like these examples
 (defaults shown):

   TMPDIR=/tmp
   MASTER=`hostname -f`
   HADOOP_RUNTIME=$(HOME)/hadoop-runtime
   ZOOKEEPER_HOME=$(HOME)/zookeeper

3. Install Hadoop configuration in hadoop-runtime:

  make install

4. Start Hadoop

(You will eventually want to run this in a screen session after
doing it a few times).

  make start


5. Test

Run a simple Map-Reduce job through the Hadoop runtime.

  make test
